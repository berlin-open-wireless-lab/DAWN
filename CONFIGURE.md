# Configuring DAWN

## Making Configuration Changes
Edit settings under

    /etc/config/dawn

After changes, restart daemon

    /etc/init.d/dawn restart

## Resetting DAWN's Configuration
The configuration for several key sections (see per section notes below)
can be shared with other DAWN
instances via ubus. This can be used to "reset" the configuration file to
remove any items that are no longer used.  To do this:

    # Backup current config
    cd /etc/config
    mv dawn dawn.old

    # Remove current config
    vi dawn # Delete all 'config metric' and 'config times' sections
    # Save and exit vi

    # On another DAWN instance
    ubus call dawn reload_config

The configuration file on the original DAWN instance should
now have newly written sections containing only current parameter values.
You can also start two instances of DAWN with an empty configuration file
then use this method to write the default configuration for the relevant
sections.

## What Can Be Configured?
The parameters that control DAWN are listed alphabetically below.  This
section describes how they are grouped to provide various features.

### Client 'Kicking'
DAWN's primary purpose is to move (aka "kick") client devices to the best
AP.  This is enabled via the `kicking` parameter.  If it is zero you will
see no devices being moved, but can use the log messages to see what would
happen.

See the following sections for details of the two main ways that DAWN may
decide to move a client device. If both methods are enabled RSSI Comparison
is evaluated first, and if it identifies a better target AP then the Absolute
RSSI method is not used.

Once DAWN has identified a device that might benefit from moving to a
different AP it does some final checks to ensure this won't be too disruptive.

- How busy the current client-AP connection is, see `bandwidth_threshold`
- Whether sufficiently better APs for the client have been consistently
found (rather than as a one-off, for example due to walking past a wall),
see `kicking_threshold` and `min_number_to_kick`

See also "Note 1: Legacy Clients"

### Kicking Method 1: RSSI Comparison
This is enabled if the `kicking` parameter is set to 1 or 3.

DAWN calculates a "score" for the actual or potential connection between
an AP and a client device.  These values are then compared to decide if a
client should be moved.  The score includes several factors:
- The radio connection quality, see "Note 2: RSSI Scoring"
- Support for 802.11 features that improve throughput, see `ht_support`,
`no_ht_support`, `vht_support` and `no_vht_support`
- How heavily the relevant radio is being used across all clients, see
`chan_util`, `chan_util_val`, `max_chan_util` and `max_chan_util_val`
- How many clients are connected to the AP, see `use_station_count` and
`max_station_diff`

### Kicking Method 2: Absolute RSSI
This is enabled if the `kicking` parameter is set to 2 or 3.

This is a simpler method where DAWN simply looks at the current RSSI radio
signal strength for the client device.  If it is below the `rssi_center`
value then a "soft" kick is done, which asks the device to look at other APs
but does not enforce this through a disconnection. Forced disconnection would be disruptive to legacy clients that may not be able to find a suitable AP to
connect to.

### Other Features
The following are less likely to need attention:
- The way 802.11v Neighbor Reports are generated can be adjusted.
    - `disassoc_nr_length` controls the number of entries in the list.
    - `set_hostapd_nr` controls the mechanism used to build the AP NR
        - "Static" will be sufficient for a small network, and contain all
the AP entries
        - "Dynamic" will allow a large network to automatically determine
a suitable set for each AP, containing a set of nearby APs
- 802.11k has several methods for gathering BEACON reports.  The
preference for Passive, Active or Table can be set via `rrm_mode`

## Configuration Notes
### Note 1: Legacy Clients
802.11v introduced the capability for clients to be "politely" asked to
move to a different AP, and DAWN uses this capability for clients that
appear to support it.

By definition, there is no way to do this for clients that don't implement
802.11v.  For these "legacy clients" DAWN can attempt to steer them away
during the PROBE / ASSOCIATE / AUTHENTICATE process by returning status
codes that indicate errors or unwillingness to accept.  It can also force
disconnection of a connected client by "tearing down" the connection,
however this is quite brutal as the client then must start a search for a
new AP, and it may just want to come back to the same AP. If DAWN
continues to try to not accept the client it is effectively denied WiFi
access.

If you enable this legacy client behaviour via parameters indicated then
you may hit challenges as it is less tested and reliable than the 802.11v
supported steering.  Reports on its success or otherwise are welcomed so
it can be refined if necessary and possible (within the constraints of
802.11).

See: `eval_probe_req`, `eval_auth_req`, `eval_assoc_req`,
`deny_auth_reason`, `deny_assoc_reason`, `min_probe_count` and `kicking`

### Note 2: RSSI Scoring
As a part of the scoring mechanism DAWN provides two mechanisms for
evaluating the client-AP RSSI (radio signal) quality.  Although DAWN does
not prevent both mechanisms being enabled at the same time (via the
relevant increment parameters) it may be difficult to obtain desired
behaviour.

Mechanism 1 is "stepped".  If the RSSI value is better than the `rssi_val`
value (or worse than the `low_rssi_val` value) then the AP score has the
`rssi` (or `low_rssi`) increment values applied.  This effective creates
three "zones" of RSSI score, which may be sufficient for many cases.  To
disable this mode set both increment values to zero.

Mechanism 2 is "graduated".  For each dB that the RSSI signal differs from
the `rssi_center` value the increment `rssi_weight` is applied.  This can
provide a more refined score, but may require more effort to get the
parameters optimised.  To disable this mode set the increment value to
zero.
